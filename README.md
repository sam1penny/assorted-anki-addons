# Assorted Anki Addons
This repository contains a collection of smaller anki add-ons that I have written.

## [Rendered Browser](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/993394845)
This add-on adds a browser that renders the cards as you search them. Can also add new cards / edit existing cards from it as the browser does. Works for anki version 2.1.28 +

## [Show Answer With Number Keys](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/188886658)
This add-on remaps the number keys (1, 2, 3, 4) to be able to show the answer of a card as well as answering it. A card can then be fully answered by simply double clicking the number key.

## [Search Cards By Length](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/819294114)
Find cards with a field of a given exact/maximum/minimum length in the browser.
